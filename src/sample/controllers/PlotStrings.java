            In the ancient times, when Earth was still flat, the god Loki
            organised a tournament.
            The first one to hunt down five legendary beasts
            would be rewarded with equally legendary The Cake.
            The greatest warriors have gathered and among them are you.
            Your task begins in the desolate lands of an abandoned kingdom.
            You feel an evil presence, lurking in the distance, waiting for you...
            The time has come, the tournament begins...""";

            The battle was hard, but you prevailed.
            Your next target is a giant spider, leaving in a cave.
            Classic!
            Looks like we're onto some good, old dungeon-crawling.

            Up to now the task seem easy.

            Your next target is rumoured to be a seasoned predator,
            whose today's hunting ground is a vast desert.
            And you hate sand. It gets everywhere.
            Let's get it over with quickly,

            Years of reading low-quality horror books
            are now going to pay off.

            Turns out that the whole tournament was some sort of nasty plot

            He made a fool out of you and what's worse:
            THE CAKE IS A LIE!
