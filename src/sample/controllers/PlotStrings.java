            In the ancient times, when Earth was still flat, the god Loki
            organised a tournament.
            The first one to hunt down three legendary beasts
            would be rewarded with equally legendary The Cake.
            The greatest warriors have gathered and among them are you.
            Your task begins in the desolate lands of an unknown desert.
            You feel an evil presence, lurking in the distance, waiting for you...

            The battle was hard, but you prevailed.
            Your next target is a giant spider, leaving in a cave.

            Now is the time for your final, third battle.

            inhabited by all sorts of creatures.
            Orcs, goblins - another classic stuff.

            THE CAKE IS A LIE!
